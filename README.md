# IBM Resiliency Orchestration and EXPRESSCLUSTER

EC provides DR (disaster recovery) solution on its failover and remote replication function.
But it does not provides DR *Drill and Report* function.
Due to it, EC cannot be proposed to bidding deal from industries regulated to do the DR Drill and Report.

The idea for the combination of EC and IBM Resiliency Orchestration (RO here after) is to make EC possible to be proposed to such a deal.

As of now (Mar 2020), at least, India and Saudi Arabia are the countries having such a legulation by authority.
