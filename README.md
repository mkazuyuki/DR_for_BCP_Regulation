# DR solution for BCP regulation

Financial and insurance industries in India and Saudi Arabia need DR **Drill** and **Report** to comply with BC regulation.

EC DR solution does not have **Drill and Report functionality** but has distributed Replication and Failover capabilities.

By combining the function in IBM Resiliency Orchestration (RO), EC is expected to go to customers who were impossible to go in the past

For EC, the value of RO are the automation of *DR Drill work flow* and of *Report creation for the drill*
