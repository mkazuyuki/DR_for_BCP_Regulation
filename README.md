# IBM Resiliency Orchestration and EXPRESSCLUSTER

EC provides the DR (disaster recovery) solution by its distributed replication and failover feature. However, it does not provide DR *Drill and Report* function.

Due to this, EC cannot be proposed for the industries requiring *DR Drill and Report* to comply the regulation by the authority. But it becomes possible by combining *Drill and Report* feature of IBM Resiliency Orchestration.

At least, India and Saudi Arabia are the countries having a regulation for *DR Drill and Report*.
