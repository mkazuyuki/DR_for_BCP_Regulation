# DR for BCP regulation

Financial and insurance industries in India and Saudi Arabia need DR **Drill-and-Report** solution to comply with BCP regulation by the authority.

EC (EXPRESSCLUSTER) DR solution does not have **Drill** and **Report** functionality but has **Replication** and **Failover** capabilities.

By combining the function in RO (**IBM Resiliency Orchestration**), EC is expected to go to the customers who were impossible to go in the past.

For EC, the value of RO are the automation of *DR Drill work flow* and of *Report creation for the drill*
